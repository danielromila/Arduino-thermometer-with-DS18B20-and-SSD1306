# Arduino-thermometer-with-DS18B20-and-SSD1306

This code is written by Sreekanth Mp and his practical implementation can be seen at

I made it first with TTGO Xi board instead of Arduino Nano. No code modification, everything exactly as Sreekanth Mp coded. The TTGO Xi board has a different microcontroller, but accepts to be dummy down to the Arduino Nano utility.
